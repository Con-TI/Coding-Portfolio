This was my first attempt at a Kaggle challenge. I tried using one of the model notebooks and editing parts, such as the model from timm used and the random data transformations (using albumentations). Some improvements would be increasing training time as I limited it to a few epochs to fit within Kaggle notebook time limits. Placed poorly (1449th place).

# Coding-Portfolio
This is my coding portfolio. **IMPORTANT: Click on the folders to check the more detailed README descriptions for each one.**

## List of projects and summaries:
- **I/O Console Indonesian LOB simulation (Language: C++, Status: Complete till further updates, Created: June 2024):**
  - This was my first C++ project. I used this to learn the syntax of C++ and some of its standard libraries. It is an agent-based Indonesian limit order book simulation (Indonesian because of the integer ticks) that displays on the terminal console as an ASCII table. The program lets you specify the number of days the simulation runs for and the number of ticks.

- **Tkinter backtesting application (Language: Python, Status: Ongoing, Created: July/August 2024)**
  - I wanted to make a backtesting application to backtest my trading ideas more easily without having to rewrite scripts, re-download data, or recreate indicators. Some libraries used include hurst for the hurst exponent, selenium, tkinter, numpy, pandas, tkcalendar, and pykalman for the kalman filter.

- **Genetic Decision Tree for Technical Trading rule generation**
  - This project is a short script trying to create a decision tree that updates every generation by changing its technical trading rules at each node. This was my attempt at recreating the algorithm described in 
the paper titled "Automatic Creation of Stock Trading Rules on the Basis of Decision Trees" by Dmitry Iskrich and Dmitry Grigoriev.

- **JaneStreet Puzzles**
  - A folder containing my solutions to Jane Street's monthly puzzles. Solved so far: October 2024 (Conrad Trey Indradjaja)

- **Kaggle Folder**
  - A folder containing my kaggle competition attempts. Kaggle competitions so far: RSNA 2024 MRI Classification

- **Andrej Karpathy Folder**
  - A folder containing the notebooks I created as I followed along Andrej Karpathy's neural network from scratch videos.
 
- **Algothon Folder**
  - A folder containing the final versions of the files used for Imperial's 2024 Algothon.
